## 1. Introduction

### Research Question

_How do the environmental conditions along the coast of California correlate to the spatiotemporal population dynamics of phytoplankton?_

### Relevance

Understanding how environmental factors are correlated to phytoplankton biomass is crucial for ecological research, fisheries management, and predicting changes in marine productivity due to climate variability. This project is significant both academically and environmentally as it provides insights into coastal ecosystem health.

### Data Description

**Source**: California Cooperative Oceanic Fishing Investigations (CalCOFI) dataset.

- **Cast Metadata**: 61 variables, 35,644 observations.
- **Bottle Data**: 62 variables, 895,371 observations.
- **Key Variables**:
  - **Phytoplankton Biomass**: Measured by 14C assimilation.
  - **Environmental Variables**: Water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations, depth, etc.

## 2. Methodology

### Data Pre-processing

- Filtering for relevant variables (e.g., temperature, salinity).
- Standardization to maintain uniformity across measurements.
- Removal of missing or extreme outlier data points for consistency.

### Analysis Methods

- **Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)**: Decomposes time-series data into trends, seasonal components, and noise, facilitating the understanding of complex data patterns.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Highlights dominant trends and reduces dimensionality, focusing on key environmental variables.
- **Clustering**: Groups data by environmental patterns to model localized conditions affecting phytoplankton biomass.

### Rationale

SSA and PCA are chosen for their effectiveness in analyzing time-series and multivariate data, respectively, providing comprehensive insights into the relationships between environmental conditions and phytoplankton dynamics.
